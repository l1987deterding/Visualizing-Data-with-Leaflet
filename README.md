In this assignment, I used the included html file and created a JavaScript file to load in a light map, geoJSON data on Earthquakes in the United states in the past 7 days, and modify the points to show the magnitude of each earthquake and the depth. The magnitude of each earthquake is indicated by color, and the depth is represented by the size of the circle.
